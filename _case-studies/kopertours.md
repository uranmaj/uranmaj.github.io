      Each tour on KoperTours is built using a **reusable Elementor + ACF template** designed for maximum flexibility and ease of use.

      - Tours are stored as custom post types with **ACF fields** for duration, price, difficulty level, location, and more.
      - Content creators can easily **populate new tours** without touching the layout.
      - All visual elements including the **hero image**, **image gallery**, and **booking descriptions** are managed directly through ACF integration.

      This structure ensures consistency across the entire site while making tour creation **fast and scalable**.

      The site integrates the **Bokun booking system** directly into each tour page using **ACF-powered iFrames**.

      - Each tour listing automatically pulls in its **Bokun availability and pricing widget**
      - Visitors can **view live prices, availability, and book instantly** without leaving the site
      - This approach enhances **user trust and conversion**, with minimal effort required to update or manage the tours

      ACF handles the iframe field, enabling editors to just **paste the Bokun code** in the backend while maintaining a clean frontend layout.
