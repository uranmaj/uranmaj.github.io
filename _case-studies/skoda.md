      The homepage **hero section** introduces the Škoda Octavia with a **dynamic, clean presentation** that reflects the brand's “Simply Clever” philosophy.

      - Built from scratch using **vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**
      - **GSAP-powered animations** enhance scroll interactions and transitions
      - UI reflects clarity, usability, and functional aesthetics in line with **Škoda’s identity**

      This concept balances technical control, structured design, and subtle motion to create an engaging front-end showcase.
