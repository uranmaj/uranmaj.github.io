      The core challenge was WooCommerce’s **inflexible variation handling**. The plugin solves this by **enforcing a selection order**:  

      1. **User selects a color** from the grid  
      2. The sidebar automatically displays the **default available size**  
      3. The user can then select alternative sizes if available  

      Each **color+size combination** has a **dedicated image**, uploaded and mapped via a **CSV file** that includes swatch previews, product images, and metadata.

      - **Swatch images** remain always visible (artist requirement)  
      - **Tube appearance** adapts to size — important for workflows involving direct application (e.g., finger painting or large brushes)  
      - CSV import enables scalable, automated variation management and **bulk image handling** without manual assignments

      The ArtPoint product page presents artists with a **color-centric interface**, allowing them to select from a **wide variety of color swatches**, each labeled with a **unique name and code**.  

      - Swatches organized in a responsive grid  
      - Labels for **easy color-code identification**  
      - A sidebar that dynamically adapts to selections

      This helps experienced artists quickly find their favorite shades, while the layout emphasizes **usability and clarity**.
